# Polymorphism-OOP-Java

Polymorphism- is the ability of an object to take more than one form. 

How?
The classes are Vehicle, Car, Bicycle, and Boat. The superclass is Vehicle and the rest are subclasses.
Create a Vehicle array to store all the objects and name it racers.
Create a go method in the Vehicle class and a for loop in the Main class.
The for loop has Vehicle as the data type, x to represent type of vehicle, and the name of the array.
Create an overriding method in each of the subclasses. All the subclasses has a println with its own message. 

***The commented line is the objects individually with a go method. But for a better way to write this code is by using the 
for loop instead and adding a go method in the Vehicle class.
